      title: "What is Computer Networking?",
      content: `Imagine you want to send a letter to a friend in another city. You write the letter, put it in an envelope, 
write the address, and drop it in a mailbox. The postal service picks it up, sorts it, routes it through 
various facilities, and eventually delivers it to your friend's mailbox. Your friend opens the envelope and reads your message.

Computer networking works remarkably similarly! When you visit a website, send an email, or stream a video, 
your computer is essentially "sending letters" to other computers. But instead of paper letters, we send 
packets of digital data. And instead of postal workers, we have routers, switches, and protocols that handle 
the delivery.

**The Key Players in Networking:**
• **Your Device (Client)**: Your computer, phone, or tablet that initiates communication
• **Servers**: Powerful computers that store websites, apps, and data, waiting to respond to requests
• **Routers**: Like postal sorting facilities - they read addresses and decide where to send packets next
• **Switches**: Connect multiple devices on the same local network, like a mail room in an office building
• **Protocols**: The agreed-upon rules for how devices communicate - like knowing to put a stamp in the corner

**Why This Matters for Security:**
Every step in this process is a potential target for attackers. They might:
• Intercept your "letters" and read them (eavesdropping)
• Forge letters that appear to come from you (spoofing)
• Overwhelm the postal system with millions of fake letters (denial of service)
• Trick the routing system into delivering letters to the wrong place (routing attacks)

Understanding how networks work is the first step to understanding how they can be exploited and defended.`

    packetsExplained: {
      title: "What is a Packet?",
      content: `When you send a file over the internet, it doesn't travel as one big chunk. Instead, it gets broken 
into smaller pieces called **packets**. Think of it like shipping a large piece of furniture - you might 
disassemble it, ship each piece separately with instructions, and reassemble it at the destination.

**Why Break Data into Packets?**
1. **Efficiency**: Multiple conversations can share the same network wires
2. **Reliability**: If one packet gets lost, only that piece needs to be resent
3. **Routing Flexibility**: Different packets can take different paths to the destination
4. **Error Handling**: Smaller chunks are easier to verify for errors

**Anatomy of a Packet:**
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  HEADERS (Address & Control Information)        │
│  ┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐   │
│  │ Source IP: 192.168.1.100                │   │
│  │ Destination IP: 142.250.80.46           │   │

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

**Security Implications:**
• Headers are usually NOT encrypted (attackers can see where traffic is going)
• Payload MAY be encrypted (with HTTPS/TLS) or may be plaintext
• Forged headers can make packets appear to come from somewhere else
• Malformed packets can crash poorly-written software`

    osiModel: {
      title: "The OSI Model: Network Layers Explained",
      content: `The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a way to understand networks by dividing them into 
7 layers, each with a specific job. Think of it like building a house - you need a foundation (physical), 
framing (structure), electrical (connectivity), and so on. Each layer depends on the ones below it.

**Layer 7 - Application Layer** 🖥️
What you see and interact with. Web browsers, email clients, chat apps.
Examples: HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SMTP, DNS
Security Issues: SQL injection, XSS, authentication bypasses

**Layer 6 - Presentation Layer** 🔤
Translates data formats, handles encryption/decryption, compression.
Examples: SSL/TLS encryption, JPEG encoding, data serialization
Security Issues: Weak encryption, format string bugs

**Layer 5 - Session Layer** 🤝
Manages sessions and connections between applications.
Examples: Session tokens, RPC sessions, NetBIOS
Security Issues: Session hijacking, fixation attacks

**Layer 4 - Transport Layer** 🚚
Ensures reliable delivery of data segments. TCP and UDP live here.
Examples: TCP (reliable), UDP (fast), port numbers
Security Issues: SYN floods, port scanning, connection hijacking

**Layer 3 - Network Layer** 🗺️
Handles addressing and routing between different networks. IP addresses.
Examples: IP, ICMP, routing protocols (BGP, OSPF)
Security Issues: IP spoofing, route hijacking, ICMP attacks

**Layer 2 - Data Link Layer** 🔗
Handles communication within the same network segment. MAC addresses.
Examples: Ethernet, Wi-Fi (802.11), ARP, switches
Security Issues: ARP spoofing, MAC flooding, VLAN hopping

**Layer 1 - Physical Layer** 🔌
The actual cables, radio waves, and electrical signals.
Examples: Ethernet cables, fiber optics, Wi-Fi radio
Security Issues: Wiretapping, jamming, physical access

**Memory Aid: "All People Seem To Need Data Processing"**
(Application, Presentation, Session, Transport, Network, Data Link, Physical)

**Why This Matters:**
When analyzing network attacks, identifying the layer helps you understand:
• What tools to use for detection
• What defenses are relevant
• What information the attacker has access to`

**A Real-World Example: Loading a Webpage**

When you type "www.google.com" and press Enter, here's what happens:

1. **Application Layer**: Your browser creates an HTTP request
2. **Transport Layer**: TCP breaks it into segments, adds port numbers (80 or 443)
3. **Internet Layer**: IP adds source and destination addresses, finds the route
4. **Network Access**: Ethernet frames the packet, sends it over the wire

At Google's server, this process reverses:
4. Network Access receives the electrical signals
3. IP layer reads the destination address, accepts the packet
2. TCP reassembles the segments, sends to the right port
1. The web server application processes your request

**TCP vs UDP: The Two Transport Protocols**

TCP (Transmission Control Protocol):
• Reliable - guarantees delivery in order
• Uses a "handshake" to establish connection
• Retransmits lost packets
• Used for: Web browsing, email, file transfers
• Slower but dependable

UDP (User Datagram Protocol):
• Fast but "best effort" - no guarantee
• No handshake needed
• Lost packets stay lost
• Used for: Video streaming, gaming, DNS queries
• Fast but unreliable

**The TCP Three-Way Handshake:**

  Client                    Server
    │                          │
    │───── SYN ───────────────>│  "Can we talk?"
    │                          │
    │<──── SYN-ACK ────────────│  "Yes, let's talk"
    │                          │
    │───── ACK ───────────────>│  "Great, starting now"
    │                          │
    │      CONNECTION          │
    │      ESTABLISHED         │

This handshake is a MAJOR attack target. SYN flood attacks abuse this by sending millions of SYNs 
without completing the handshake, exhausting server resources.`
    },
    ipAddressing: {
      title: "IP Addresses: The Postal Addresses of the Internet",
      content: `Every device on the internet needs a unique address so data can find it. That's what IP addresses do.
There are two versions in use today: IPv4 (older, more common) and IPv6 (newer, gradually being adopted).

**IPv4 Addresses:**
Format: Four numbers (0-255) separated by dots
Example: 192.168.1.100

Each number is 8 bits (1 byte), so IPv4 = 32 bits total
Total possible addresses: ~4.3 billion (we've run out!)

**Private vs Public IP Addresses:**

Private IPs (used inside your network):
• 10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255
• 172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255  
• 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255

These addresses are NOT routable on the internet. Your home router uses NAT 
(Network Address Translation) to let multiple devices share one public IP.

Public IPs (routable on the internet):
• Everything else
• Your ISP assigns you one (or more)
• This is what websites see when you connect

**IPv6 Addresses:**
Format: Eight groups of 4 hex digits, separated by colons
Example: 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334
Shortened: 2001:db8:85a3::8a2e:370:7334

IPv6 = 128 bits = 340 undecillion addresses (enough for every atom on Earth!)

**Ports: The Apartment Numbers**

If an IP address is like a street address, a port is like an apartment number.
One server (one IP) can run many services (many ports).

Well-Known Ports (0-1023):
• 21: FTP (file transfer)
• 22: SSH (secure shell)
• 23: Telnet (insecure remote access)
• 25: SMTP (email sending)
• 53: DNS (domain name resolution)
• 80: HTTP (web traffic)
• 443: HTTPS (secure web traffic)
• 445: SMB (Windows file sharing)
• 3389: RDP (Windows remote desktop)

**Security Implications:**
• Attackers scan ports to find running services
• Services on unexpected ports might be hiding
• Open ports = potential attack surface
• Every listening port should be intentional and secured`
    },
    howDataFlows: {
      title: "How Data Actually Flows Across the Internet",
      content: `Let's trace what happens when you visit https://www.example.com from start to finish.
This will tie together everything we've discussed.

**Step 1: DNS Resolution** 🔍
Your browser doesn't know what 142.250.80.46 is. It only knows "www.example.com"

Browser → "Hey OS, what's the IP for www.example.com?"
OS → Checks local cache, then asks your configured DNS server
DNS Server → "That's 93.184.216.34"
OS → Caches the answer, tells browser

**Step 2: TCP Connection** 🤝
Your browser needs to establish a connection to port 443 (HTTPS)

Your PC ──SYN──────────> example.com:443
Your PC <──SYN-ACK────── example.com:443  
Your PC ──ACK──────────> example.com:443
Connection established!

**Step 3: TLS Handshake** 🔐
Before sending any data, we need to set up encryption

Browser → "Hello! I support TLS 1.3, these ciphers..."
Server → "Great, let's use TLS 1.3 with AES-256. Here's my certificate"
Browser → Verifies certificate is valid and trusted
Both → Derive shared encryption keys
Secure channel established!

**Step 4: HTTP Request** 📤
Now your browser sends the actual request (encrypted)

GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: www.example.com
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0...
Accept: text/html...

**Step 5: Server Processing** ⚙️
example.com's web server:
• Receives the request
• Finds the homepage file
• Prepares the response

**Step 6: HTTP Response** 📥
Server sends back (encrypted):

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/html
Content-Length: 1256

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>...

**Step 7: Rendering** 🖼️
Browser decrypts, parses HTML, requests CSS/JS/images, renders the page

**Step 8: Connection Teardown** 👋
When done, TCP gracefully closes:

PC ──FIN──> Server
PC <──ACK── Server
PC <──FIN── Server
PC ──ACK──> Server

**Attack Opportunities at Each Step:**

Step 1 (DNS): DNS spoofing, cache poisoning
Step 2 (TCP): SYN floods, connection hijacking
Step 3 (TLS): Downgrade attacks, cert spoofing
Step 4 (HTTP): Request smuggling, header injection
Step 5 (Server): Application vulnerabilities
Step 6 (Response): Response splitting, injection
Step 7 (Rendering): XSS, malicious content
Step 8 (Teardown): Connection reuse attacks`

  // Expanded glossary with detailed beginner-friendly explanations
  const expandedGlossary = [
    { 
      term: "Handshake", 
      shortDesc: "Initial exchange that sets up a connection or session.",
      fullExplanation: `A handshake is like introducing yourself before a conversation. In networking, devices 
exchange initial messages to agree on how they'll communicate. The TCP three-way handshake (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK) 
is the most famous example - it ensures both sides are ready before sending real data. TLS also has a handshake 
to negotiate encryption. Handshakes are common attack targets because they happen before security is fully established.`
    },
    { 
      term: "Stateful Protocol", 
      shortDesc: "Protocol that tracks session state on both ends.",
      fullExplanation: `A stateful protocol remembers past interactions. TCP is stateful - it tracks sequence numbers, 
which packets were acknowledged, what data was already sent. This is like having a conversation where you remember 
what was said before. The downside? The server must allocate memory for each connection, creating opportunities for 
"state exhaustion" attacks where attackers create many partial connections to consume all server memory.`
    },
    { 
      term: "Stateless Protocol", 
      shortDesc: "Protocol with no session memory between packets.",
      fullExplanation: `A stateless protocol treats each request independently, with no memory of past requests. UDP and 
HTTP (in its basic form) are stateless. Each request contains all information needed to process it. This is efficient 
but has security implications - there's no built-in way to verify that sequential packets came from the same sender, 
making spoofing attacks easier. It's like talking to someone with amnesia - every sentence is brand new to them.`
    },
    { 
      term: "Downgrade Attack", 
      shortDesc: "Forcing a weaker protocol version or cipher.",
      fullExplanation: `A downgrade attack tricks systems into using older, weaker security settings even when both sides 
support stronger ones. For example, an attacker might manipulate a TLS handshake to force TLS 1.0 instead of TLS 1.3, 
then exploit known vulnerabilities in the older version. It's like a thief convincing you to use a simple door lock 
instead of your deadbolt by claiming the deadbolt is "broken." Defense: disable legacy versions entirely so there's 
nothing to downgrade to.`
    },
    { 
      term: "Amplification Attack", 
      shortDesc: "Small request triggers a much larger response.",
      fullExplanation: `In an amplification attack, the attacker sends a small request that generates a huge response, 
and spoofs the source address to be the victim's IP. The victim gets flooded with responses they never requested. 
DNS amplification is notorious - a 60-byte query can generate a 3000-byte response (50x amplification). NTP and 
memcached have even higher ratios. It's like signing someone up for 1000 catalogs using a single postcard - minimal 
effort for the attacker, maximum annoyance for the victim.`
    },
    { 
      term: "Parsing", 
      shortDesc: "How a system reads and interprets protocol data.",
      fullExplanation: `Parsing is how software makes sense of raw data. When your browser receives HTTP, it must parse 
the headers, understand the content-length, find where the body starts, etc. Security bugs arise when different systems 
parse the same data differently. If a firewall parses a request one way but the server parses it another way, attackers 
can craft requests that the firewall thinks are safe but the server interprets as malicious. This is called a 
"parser differential" and enables attacks like HTTP request smuggling.`
    },
    { 
      term: "ALPN", 
      shortDesc: "TLS extension to negotiate application protocols.",
      fullExplanation: `ALPN (Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation) is a TLS extension that lets clients and servers 
agree on which application protocol to use (HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, HTTP/3) during the TLS handshake, before any application 
data is sent. This saves a round-trip compared to negotiating after TLS is established. Security relevance: ALPN choices 
can reveal what services are running, and misconfigurations might allow unexpected protocol negotiation.`
    },
    { 
      term: "Fragmentation", 
      shortDesc: "Splitting packets to fit network MTU limits.",
      fullExplanation: `Networks have a Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) - the largest packet size they can handle 
(typically 1500 bytes for Ethernet). Larger data must be split (fragmented) into smaller pieces. The destination 
reassembles them. Security issues: fragments can be used to evade security tools that only inspect the first 
fragment, and reassembly vulnerabilities have caused crashes and code execution (the infamous "Ping of Death" 
and more recent fragmentation attacks).`
    },
    { 
      term: "Replay Attack", 
      shortDesc: "Reusing captured traffic to impersonate a valid session.",
      fullExplanation: `In a replay attack, an attacker captures legitimate network traffic and retransmits it later 
to trick the server. If you capture someone logging in, you might be able to replay that login sequence to gain 
access. Defenses include timestamps, sequence numbers, and nonces (one-time values) that make old traffic invalid. 
TLS sessions include mechanisms to prevent replay, but application-layer protocols sometimes forget to add their own.`
    },
    { 
      term: "Digital Signature", 
      shortDesc: "Cryptographic proof that data was not modified.",
      fullExplanation: `A digital signature is like a tamper-evident seal that also proves who created the content. 
It uses asymmetric cryptography - the sender uses their private key to create a signature, and anyone with their 
public key can verify it. If even one bit of the signed data changes, verification fails. Used in TLS certificates, 
code signing, email (S/MIME, PGP), and protocol integrity checks (like SMB signing). Without signatures, attackers 
can modify data in transit without detection.`
    },
    { 
      term: "Session Resumption", 
      shortDesc: "Reusing prior TLS parameters to reduce handshake overhead.",
      fullExplanation: `A full TLS handshake is expensive - multiple round-trips, CPU-intensive cryptography. Session 
resumption lets a client and server reuse previously negotiated parameters to skip most of this work. There are two 
methods: session IDs (server stores state) and session tickets (client stores encrypted state). Security consideration: 
if session secrets are compromised, all resumed sessions are compromised. Also, session tickets must be encrypted with 
keys that are rotated regularly.`
    },
    { 
      term: "Man-in-the-Middle (MITM)", 
      shortDesc: "Attacker secretly intercepts and possibly alters communication.",
      fullExplanation: `In a MITM attack, the attacker positions themselves between two communicating parties, 
intercepting all traffic. They might just eavesdrop, or actively modify messages. Think of it as someone standing 
between you and your friend, passing notes - they can read them, change them, or replace them entirely. TLS is 
designed to prevent MITM attacks through certificate verification, but attacks exist: rogue Wi-Fi hotspots, ARP 
spoofing on local networks, compromised routers, and users clicking through certificate warnings.`
    },
    { 
      term: "Spoofing", 
      shortDesc: "Forging the source address or identity of network traffic.",
      fullExplanation: `Spoofing is pretending to be someone else. IP spoofing means sending packets with a fake source 
IP address. ARP spoofing means claiming to have a different MAC address. DNS spoofing means returning fake DNS answers. 
Spoofing is easiest with connectionless protocols (UDP) because there's no handshake to verify identity. Even TCP can 
be spoofed with enough guessing of sequence numbers. Defenses include ingress filtering (BCP38), cryptographic 
authentication, and monitoring for anomalies.`
    },
    { 
      term: "Encapsulation", 
      shortDesc: "Wrapping data in successive protocol headers as it moves down the stack.",
      fullExplanation: `As data travels down the network stack, each layer adds its own header (and sometimes trailer) 
around the data from the layer above. HTTP data gets wrapped in TCP headers, which gets wrapped in IP headers, which 
gets wrapped in Ethernet frames. At the destination, each layer strips off its header and passes the payload up. 
Understanding encapsulation helps you read packet captures - you're peeling off layers to see what's inside.`
    },
    { 
      term: "Checksum", 
      shortDesc: "Simple integrity check calculated from packet data.",
      fullExplanation: `A checksum is a value calculated from packet contents to detect transmission errors. TCP and IP 
both include checksums. However, checksums are NOT security features - they protect against accidental corruption, not 
intentional modification. An attacker who changes the data can recalculate a valid checksum. For security, you need 
cryptographic hashes or MACs (Message Authentication Codes), which require a secret key to compute.`

TCP ensures every piece of data arrives correctly and in order. It's like sending a package with tracking and signature 
confirmation - you know it arrived, and the recipient confirms they got it.`,
      howItWorks: `1. **Connection Setup (Three-Way Handshake)**:
   • Client sends SYN: "I want to talk, here's my starting sequence number"
   • Server sends SYN-ACK: "Okay, here's my starting sequence number too"
   • Client sends ACK: "Got it, let's begin"

2. **Data Transfer**:
   • Data is split into segments with sequence numbers
   • Receiver acknowledges each segment received
   • If acknowledgment doesn't arrive, sender retransmits

3. **Connection Teardown**:
   • Either side sends FIN: "I'm done sending"
   • Other side acknowledges and sends their FIN
   • Final acknowledgment closes the connection`,

real-time applications like video calls, gaming, and DNS lookups where speed matters more than occasional lost packets.`,
      howItWorks: `UDP is beautifully simple:
1. Application says "send this data to IP:port"
2. UDP adds a minimal header (source port, dest port, length, checksum)
3. Packet is sent - no handshake, no waiting, no confirmation
4. If it arrives, great. If not, the application must handle it.

The header is only 8 bytes (vs TCP's 20+ bytes), making UDP more efficient for small messages.`,

    stateExhaustion: {
      title: "State Exhaustion Attacks",
      icon: "💀",
      summary: "Consume server resources by creating many partial or long-lived sessions until the server can't accept new connections.",
      
      deepExplanation: `**The Core Concept:**
Stateful protocols like TCP need to track information about each connection. When you start a TCP connection, 
the server creates a data structure in memory to track that connection's state. This includes:
• Sequence numbers for ordering packets
• Window sizes for flow control
• Timeout values
• Source/destination addresses and ports

**The Attack:**
An attacker exploits this by creating many connections without completing them or by keeping them alive 
indefinitely. Since each connection consumes memory and CPU, enough partial connections will exhaust the 
server's resources, preventing legitimate users from connecting.

**Types of State Exhaustion:**

1. **SYN Flood**: Send millions of SYN packets without completing the handshake
   - Server allocates memory for each half-open connection
   - Backlog queue fills up, new connections dropped

2. **Slowloris**: Open connections and send requests very slowly
   - Keep connection alive but never complete the request
   - Web servers often limit concurrent connections per IP

3. **RUDY (R-U-Dead-Yet)**: Send POST requests with very slow body
   - Server waits for complete body before processing
   - Resources tied up waiting

**Why It Works:**
Servers must be ready to handle legitimate slow connections. The internet has variable latency, so servers 
can't just close slow connections immediately. Attackers exploit this tolerance.`,

      technicalDetails: `**TCP Backlog:**
When a SYN arrives, Linux adds an entry to the SYN backlog queue. This queue has a limited size 
(controlled by net.ipv4.tcp_max_syn_backlog). Once full, new SYNs are dropped.

**SYN Cookies - The Defense:**
Instead of storing state, the server encodes connection info into the initial sequence number 
returned in the SYN-ACK. If a valid ACK returns, the server can reconstruct the connection state. 
No memory needed until the handshake completes!

Enable with: sysctl -w net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies=1

**Connection Table:**
Fully established connections live in a hash table. The size is also limited. Tools like 
"netstat" or "ss" show current connections and states.`,

    amplificationReflection: {
      title: "Amplification & Reflection Attacks",
      icon: "📡",
      summary: "Abuse UDP services to multiply attack traffic - send small requests with spoofed source, get huge responses sent to victim.",

      deepExplanation: `**The Core Concept:**
Some network services respond with much more data than they receive. If an attacker can make requests 
appear to come from someone else (spoofing), they can use these services as "amplifiers" to attack 
the victim with traffic they never requested.

**How It Works:**

1. Attacker sends small UDP request to vulnerable service
2. Source IP in the request is forged to be the victim's IP
3. Server sends large response to the "source" (victim)
4. Victim gets flooded with responses they never asked for

**Why UDP?**
UDP has no handshake - the server just responds to wherever the packet says it came from. 
TCP can't be amplified because the three-way handshake requires the real source to respond.

**Amplification Factors:**
• DNS: 28-54x (ask for ANY record on large domain)
• NTP: 556x (monlist command returns list of recent clients)
• Memcached: 51,000x (statistics command returns huge response)
• SSDP: 30x (UPnP discovery)
• CharGen: Infinite (responds with endless character stream)

**The Math:**
If attacker has 100 Mbps bandwidth and uses 50x amplification:
100 Mbps × 50 = 5 Gbps hitting the victim
The attacker's connection doesn't need to be big - they're using others' bandwidth.`,

      technicalDetails: `**DNS Amplification Details:**
Query: dig ANY example.com @open-resolver (small ~60 bytes)
Response: Full zone information (potentially 3000+ bytes)

The attacker finds "open resolvers" - DNS servers that answer queries from anyone.
They send millions of spoofed queries, all appearing to come from the victim.

**NTP Monlist:**
The monlist command asks an NTP server for the list of its 600 most recent clients.
Request: 8 bytes
Response: Up to 48,000 bytes (600 entries × 80 bytes)

Most patched now, but millions of vulnerable servers existed.

**BCP38 - The Prevention:**
If every ISP implemented BCP38 (ingress filtering), spoofed packets would be dropped 
at the network edge. Unfortunately, adoption is incomplete.`,

    downgradeAttacks: {
      title: "Protocol Downgrade Attacks",
      icon: "⬇️",
      summary: "Force systems to use older, weaker protocol versions that have known vulnerabilities.",

      deepExplanation: `**The Core Concept:**
For backward compatibility, many systems support both old and new protocol versions. During negotiation, 
they agree on the newest version both support. An attacker can manipulate this negotiation to force 
use of the oldest, weakest version - which may have known vulnerabilities.

**Where Downgrades Happen:**

1. **TLS Version**: Force TLS 1.0 instead of TLS 1.3
   - TLS 1.0 has known attacks (BEAST, POODLE)
   - Weak cipher suites still available

2. **SMB Version**: Force SMBv1 instead of SMBv3
   - SMBv1 has no signing or encryption
   - Vulnerable to EternalBlue

3. **SSH Algorithms**: Force weak ciphers or key exchange
   - Older SSH can use DES, small keys
   - Might enable known attacks

4. **HTTP Version**: Force HTTP/1.1 instead of HTTP/2
   - Missing security headers
   - Request smuggling easier

**The POODLE Attack (Example):**
POODLE exploited a flaw in SSL 3.0's CBC padding. Even if both client and server supported TLS 1.2, 
an attacker could cause connection failures until they fell back to SSL 3.0, then exploit it.

**Why This Works:**
Protocols are designed for graceful degradation - if the newest version fails, try an older one. 
This is good for reliability but bad for security. Attackers exploit this by making the newer 
versions appear to fail.`,

      technicalDetails: `**TLS Downgrade Prevention:**
TLS 1.3 includes "downgrade sentinel" - a special value in the ServerHello random field 
that alerts clients to potential downgrade attacks.

Clients should check for: 
0x44 0x4F 0x57 0x4E 0x47 0x52 0x44 0x01 (TLS 1.2)
0x44 0x4F 0x57 0x4E 0x47 0x52 0x44 0x00 (TLS 1.1 or below)

**Testing for Downgrade:**
# Use testssl.sh to check
./testssl.sh --protocols example.com

# Or openssl
openssl s_client -connect example.com:443 -tls1

**Preventing Downgrade:**
Best defense is disabling legacy versions entirely. If you only support TLS 1.2+, 
there's nothing to downgrade to.`,

    parserMismatch: {
      title: "Parser Mismatch & Desync",
      icon: "🔀",
      summary: "Exploit differences in how systems interpret the same protocol data to bypass security controls.",

      deepExplanation: `**The Core Concept:**
When a request passes through multiple systems (firewall → load balancer → web server), each system 
parses the protocol differently. If they disagree on where one request ends and another begins, 
an attacker can craft requests that look safe to the firewall but dangerous to the backend.

**HTTP Request Smuggling (Classic Example):**

HTTP has two ways to indicate body length:
• Content-Length: 13 (body is exactly 13 bytes)
• Transfer-Encoding: chunked (body sent in chunks with sizes)

What if a request has BOTH headers with different values?
• Front-end uses Content-Length
• Back-end uses Transfer-Encoding
• They disagree on where the request ends!

**The Attack:**
Attacker sends one request that the front-end sees as ONE request, but the back-end sees as TWO.
The "hidden" second request can bypass security, access other users' data, or execute unauthorized actions.

POST / HTTP/1.1
Content-Length: 13
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

0

GET /admin HTTP/1.1
...

Front-end: "This is a normal POST to /"
Back-end: "This is POST to / followed by GET to /admin"

**Why It's Dangerous:**
• Bypass WAF rules
• Access other users' sessions
• Cache poisoning
• Reflected XSS without user interaction`,

      technicalDetails: `**CL.TE vs TE.CL:**
CL.TE: Front-end uses Content-Length, Back-end uses Transfer-Encoding
TE.CL: Front-end uses Transfer-Encoding, Back-end uses Content-Length

Each requires different payload construction.

**Testing:**
Use Burp Suite's HTTP Request Smuggler extension
Or manually test with timing differences

**Related: HTTP/2 Downgrade Smuggling:**
HTTP/2 gets translated to HTTP/1.1 by some proxies.
Attackers craft HTTP/2 requests that become malicious HTTP/1.1.

**Defense:**
1. Ensure all systems parse identically (hard)
2. Reject ambiguous requests
3. Use HTTP/2 end-to-end
4. Keep proxy software patched and aligned`,

    nameResolutionAttacks: {
      title: "Name Resolution Manipulation",
      icon: "🗺️",
      summary: "Abuse DNS or local name resolution to redirect traffic to attacker-controlled systems.",

      deepExplanation: `**The Core Concept:**
Before your computer can talk to google.com, it needs to know Google's IP address. Name resolution 
services (DNS, LLMNR, NBNS, mDNS) perform this translation. If an attacker can control name resolution, 
they control where your traffic goes.

**Attack Vectors:**

1. **DNS Cache Poisoning:**
   - Inject fake answers into a resolver's cache
   - All users of that resolver get wrong answers
   - Can redirect banking.com to attacker's server

2. **LLMNR/NBNS Poisoning (Windows):**
   - Windows asks the local network for unknown names
   - Attacker responds first with their own IP
   - Victim connects to attacker instead

3. **Rogue DHCP:**
   - Attacker sets up DHCP server on network
   - Victims get attacker's DNS servers
   - All DNS queries go through attacker

4. **DNS Rebinding:**
   - Attacker's domain initially resolves to attacker
   - Browser loads attacker's JavaScript
   - DNS changes to victim's internal IP
   - JavaScript now accesses internal network

**Why LLMNR/NBNS Is Bad:**
When you mistype a server name, Windows asks the whole network "who is FLESHARE?"
Any device can respond. Attackers run Responder to answer with their IP, 
then capture the authentication attempt.`,

      technicalDetails: `**Responder Attack:**
# Start Responder on Linux
sudo responder -I eth0 -wrf

When Windows user types \\\\wrongservername
- Responder answers the LLMNR query
- User's machine tries to authenticate to Responder
- Responder captures NTLMv2 hash
- Hash can be cracked offline or relayed

**DNS Spoofing at Protocol Level:**
DNS queries have a transaction ID (16 bits = 65536 possibilities).
Attacker must guess the ID to inject fake response.
Kaminsky attack improved odds by guessing many IDs quickly.

**DNSSEC:**
Cryptographically signs DNS records.
Resolvers can verify answers came from authoritative source.
Adoption still incomplete (~30% of domains).`,

**What DPI Reveals:**
• HTTP requests/responses
• DNS queries and answers
• File transfers
• Application identification
• Malware command & control

**Challenges:**
• Encryption blinds DPI (TLS, HTTPS)
• Performance overhead
• Privacy concerns
• Evasion techniques (tunneling, steganography)

**TLS Inspection:**
Some organizations decrypt TLS at a proxy to inspect content.
Controversial: breaks end-to-end encryption, adds attack surface.`,

5. Alerts on rules/anomalies
6. Enables investigation and hunting

**Correlation Example:**
Single event: "Failed login" - probably nothing

- 100 failed logins from same IP
- Followed by successful login
- Then access to sensitive file
- Then data upload to external site

**Signature/Rule-Based:**
• Define specific patterns to match
• "If source_country != company_locations AND login_success THEN alert"
• Low false positives for known attacks
• Blind to novel attacks

**Anomaly/Behavioral:**
• Learn what's "normal"
• Alert on deviations
• "This user normally logs in 9-5 from New York, but just logged in at 3 AM from Russia"
• Can detect unknown attacks
• Higher false positive rate

**Best Practice:** Use both! Rules for known-bad, anomalies for unknown.`,

**Example Hypothesis:**
"Attackers may have compromised credentials and are moving laterally via RDP to reach database servers."

**Testing the Hypothesis:**
1. Identify all RDP connections to database servers

3. Validate user accounts are legitimate
4. Look for suspicious timing or volume

• Techniques: How they achieve the goal (e.g., "Pass the Hash", "Data Encrypted")
• Procedures: Specific implementation details from real attacks

**Using ATT&CK for Hunting:**
1. Pick a technique you haven't hunted recently
2. Read about detection methods in the ATT&CK page
3. Search your logs/traffic for those indicators
4. Document findings and improve detection

**Example:** Technique T1003 - OS Credential Dumping
Hunt for: LSASS access, suspicious process spawning from lsass.exe, memory dump files

• Long DNS queries (tunneling)
• Connections to newly registered domains
• Large data transfers at night

**Account Behaviors:**

• Admin accounts used from non-admin workstations
• Accounts used from multiple locations simultaneously

**Key Insight:** Behaviors are harder to change than indicators (IPs, hashes). Attackers who change tactics are slowed down.`,

                    Network protocols are designed for reliability and interoperability, not for security first. Attackers
                    exploit those design gaps by abusing state, forcing downgrades, or leveraging inconsistent parsing. This
